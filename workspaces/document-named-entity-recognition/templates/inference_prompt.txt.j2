Extract the following relations from the text. Each relation should be returned in the format: "key predicate value >>>". Ensure the key, predicate, and value appear exactly as they are in the text. If the value is missing, leave it empty.
**Do not hallucinate or invent details** that are not present in the text.
Key should always before the predicate and the value should always come after the predicate.

Steps:
1. **Reasoning**: First, analyze the text and identify the entities and relationships between them.
2. **Extraction**: Once the relationships are clear, extract each one in the format: `key predicate value >>>`
3. **Format**: Use the exact wording from the text for `key`, `predicate`, and `value`. If any value is missing, leave it empty.

Text:
{{ text }}

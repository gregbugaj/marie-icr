## 2. Annotation Process:
   - For every valid Claim End row:
     - Annotate it as:
       ```
       [ROW NUMBER] | CLAIM END: ISSUED AMT: [AMOUNT or NO PAY]
       ```

## 3. Handle Invalid Cases:
   - If no valid **CLAIM END** rows with **ISSUED AMT** are found:
     - Respond with:
       ```
       NO-CLAIM-END-FOUND
       ```

## 4. Output Requirements:
   - Annotate all valid **CLAIM END** rows from the OCR results.
   - Ensure annotations include the **ISSUED AMT** value and any additional text in the same row.

## 5. Format:
   - Provide annotations in the format:
     ```
     [ROW NUMBER] | CLAIM END: ISSUED AMT: [AMOUNT or NO PAY]
     ...
     ```
## 5. Provide reasoning for each annotation to ensure clarity and accuracy, print the row before and after the annotation to provide context.

# Coding standards

To ensure the readability of our code, we stick to a few conventions:

* We format python files using black.
* For linting, we use flake8.
* For sorting imports, we use isort.


The `setup.cfg` and `pyproject.toml` already contain the proper configuration for these tools. 
If you are working in a modern IDE (such a VSCode), which integrates these tools, the options will be picked up.
If you are working from the command line, you should use these tools form the root of this repository or via a `make` file.



We also provide a .pre-commit-config.yaml file, which enables you to use pre-commit to automatically perform the required linting/formatting actions before you commit your changes. 
You can install it using
```shell
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

## Downloading large artifacts

Often you will find that for the executor to work, a large file needs to be downloaded first - usually this would be a file with pre-trained model weights. If this is done at the start of the executor, it will lead to really long startup times, or even timeouts, which will frustrate users.
If this file is baked in the docker image (not even possible in all cases), this will create overly large docker images, and prevent users for optimizing storage in cases where they want to run multiple instances of the executor on the same machine, among other things.

The solution in this case is to instruct users how to download the file before starting the executor, and then use that file in their executor. So for this case, you should:

* Add simple copy-pastable instructions on how to download the large files to the readme
* Add instructions on how to specify the path to the file at executor initialization (if needed) and how to mount the file to a Docker container in the readme
* If the file path is not provided, or the file doesn't exist, add an error telling the user that file needs to be downloaded, and pointing them to the readme for further instructions.
